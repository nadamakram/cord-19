worried holly fg 2 nevertheless participant also sensitive towards displayed concern people deemed risk participants cited people chronic health problem asthma vulnerable immune system pregnant woman

carly fg 7 similarly pregnant woman also displayed greater level concern as one woman explained i learned immunity pregnant - lowered i've worried jenny fg 6 participants identified two key source providing information help ass threat swine flu medium government less common family friend health professionals as one participant said i think i've picked anything anywhere apart media that's source input swine flu jackie fg 8 it wa common participant mention early phase pandemic believed wa much news coverage caused feel anxious for instance rob remarked i listen radio one every single morning every single morning would like 'swine flu ' i wa like 'shut i've enough' they keep get message important rob fg 1 participants also judged since summer 2009 decline medium interest for example one participant commented i've really noticed newspaper stuff paying much attention anymore ciara fg 11 the rationale participant gave decline coverage wa early prediction over-estimated prevalence severity swine flu it's bad thought going make front page tabloids peter fg 12 the medium coverage swine flu wa also described many participant 'scaremongering' they often expressed concern medium deliberately tried induce unnecessary panic in one group concluded emma they've media set managed get everyone majority people quite panic whole thing sarah they purpose whip panic anxiety people fg 4 similarly participant another group assessed media's role information source stated ellie at first basically saying 'that we're doomed ' that's impression giving i found wa unnecessary sophie yes intent cause hysteria people i find i've seen people lapping worrying fg 1 in three group medium also criticized covering swine flu expense serious disease pose greater threat lives for instance one participant group student nurse commented mia before swine flu came along mrsa c-diff wa news like awful lot nowadays hear like nothing still around - people like still need know like affect well katy no dropped something new big ha come along fg 5 despite using medium key information source wa also common participant express distrust information provided medium motif behind medium coverage one participant explained frustration questioned one paper tell one thing another paper tell different thing altogether so actually rely medium give proper information amber fg 8 the second key source assessing threat swine flu wa government all participant seen government's public awareness campaign 'catch bin kill it' however almost described information contained within campaign 'common sense' 'obvious' wa mixed response value only 8 participant believed increased hand washing usage tissue since campaign nevertheless government generally viewed handled swine flu situation reasonably well a typical view wa expressed focus group 13 craig they i would expect done i think achieved anything spectacularly impressive time i know reacted people expected react can't criticise done alexa em exactly reacted proportion people's expectations kyla and perceived threat time craig yeah exactly fg 13 at time focus group took place participant aware uk government ordered enough vaccine entire population begun stock piling vaccine vulnerable people participants commonly expressed view felt reassured government ordered enough vaccines i think good vaccine vulnerable people feel protected we're lucky co country got fast enough get enough vaccine whole population diane fg 8 participants across group seemed well informed swine flu could transmitted person person sneezing touching contaminated objects knew recommended infection control measure adopt participants commonly reported knowing government recommendation hand washing using tissue sneezing however participant believe changed current hand washing practice incorporated new practice daily routine for instance fran fg 9 stated i can't say i've changed anything co i already hand washing others might benefit advice really in respect wa common participant view government campaign potential benefit others a participant mention avoiding public transport wearing glove touching communal object hand rails ticket machine toilet door handle fg5 fg6 fg 8 fg 12 no participant spoke using facial masks participants asked view development swine flu vaccine the issue vaccine safety cropped groups the key concern expressed speed development whether sufficiently trialled for instance one participant commented there's enough trial done sent they're rush get people kelly fg 2 it wa also common participant link perception rushed trial concern long-term side-effects for example one participant said tested implication body five year time ten year time worry mia fg 5 although group discussed concern vaccine safety questioned whether enough research done assure use one participant offered alternative assessment it's kind they're damned damned i think come vaccine swine flu we'd like 'well playing come - get sorted ' and like 'oh wa bit fast wa fast liking' sophie fg 1 when asked difference vaccine swine flu seasonal flu participant typically unsure for example one participant asked this really stupid question normal flu h1n1 swine flu h1n1 what's difference vaccines beth fg 1 participants also knew little seasonal influenza vaccine wondered whether would effective swine flu this confusion led three participant suggest seasonal flu vaccine must safer option effective year dave fg 1 anna fg 10 zoe fg 13 when participant asked whether would accept reject swine flu vaccination offered split accepting refusing vaccination undecided many participant discussed weighing risk benefit vaccination way making decision one man reasoned none u got underlying health issues none u get ill often risk swine flu seems quite slim need vaccine actually that's calculation anyway peter fg 12 whilst many participant wa hypothetical question pregnant woman group discussion offered vaccine seemed anxious uncritically accepting it wa typical participant express concern safety vaccine for instance one woman explained i think worry testing has tested know taking going affect baby i take emily fg 6 three participant also stated planning vaccine mentioned case thalidomide highlighting danger insufficiently tested drug taken pregnancy however one participant wa scathing link swine flu vaccination thalidomide stating i think thalidomide thing like that's completely unrelated that's got absolutely nothing that's borne ignorance i concerns concern enough get vaccination nicole fg 6 it wa common woman mention felt mixed message regarding medication pregnancy for example one woman commented concern co drummed pregnant taking medication amy fg 6 trust wa issue emerged several group discussions particularly pregnant woman discussing decision whether vaccine many participant unsure whether could trust advice vaccinate the group participant expressed concern vaccine safety mother young children one mother questioned know much vaccine put body it's researched long i would rather wait he's healthy wait see finger crossed ever know contract swine flu jasmin fg 12 similarly another mother weighed risk considered i vaccinate i think risk swine flu great enough children mary fg 7 however participant keen child vaccinated particularly felt child wa vulnerable infection for example one mother whose son asthma believed son quite prone illness chest infections kelly fg12 reasoned would benefit additional protection there wa also one mother whose child underlying health issue wa keen son vaccinated she commented younger kid tend get illness play together know everything so i think age group vital group give amber fg 8 a participant also spoke accepting vaccine altruistically mean protecting vulnerable populations for instance one participant stated protecting vulnerable people protection know vulnerable people end day anything else emily fg6 the aim study wa conduct in-depth exploration public perception concern swine flu pandemic order gain insight people deciphered threat perceived could control risks order pinpoint knowledge gap shape future pandemic

disease control participants meeting affirmed culture tolerate corruption indicated lack transparency raise suspicion corrupt dealings government authority leader expected open consult community making important decisions including public health emergency decisions affecting people factors complicate mass communication discussed meeting include low level literacy inaccessibility medium television newspapers internet poverty unavailability internet cell phone tower rural areas although detail depth discussion regionally varied cultural variation wa evident transparency decision-making wa general decisively affirmed at african meeting contrast general perception “big men” individual centralized power make decisions participant agreed traditional culture expect leader

countries active resource poor country africa seeking meet populations’ basic needs thus important traditional healer ngos engaged decision-making process the participant asian meeting varied widely view practice relating informing engaging public for example sars broke one asian country government issued mandatory public health measure expected public compliance due culture deference authority nearly community country instantly adopted measure eg quarantine isolation social distancing however participant reported deference authority this wa reflected story another asian country boycott government polio immunization campaign minority community due suspicion government’s motives others reported central government wa perceived misgoverned weak responsibility informing public health threat providing leadership emergency fell local leaders participants latin american meeting stressed community participation cooperation crucial pandemic influenza response particularly migrant minority already stigmatized latin american participant also pointed importance medium health authority communicating health information avoiding panic well convey factual information availability

accountability transparency public health policies also noted reluctance among country collaborate political difference disparity wealth resources participants discussed need establish clear understanding make decision emergency guideline established importance considering multiple perspectives including perspective individual risk economic demographic geographical population vulnerability factor common challenge identified affecting resource allocation decisions these challenge shared region meeting occurred participants agreed cultural regional variations “one size fit

meetings participants felt planning response take account contextual variation cultural differences additionally participant discussed issue resource allocation within framework transparency especially preferential treatment given powerful community member opposed vulnerable the african meeting participant affirmed importance providing resource young noted important difference perspective among countries many african society give higher status elderly age groups with life expectancy african country 40 even 30s proportion population composed young child much higher countries thus african countries preference allocating scarce resource child would leave little resource segment population generally african country much rural country continents making access village difficult whether road telephone internet although meeting attendee feel rural urban habitation criterion allocation resources anticipated logistical challenge would make these concern dwarfed however likelihood resource antiviral vaccine far scarcer african country elsewhere continent’s dual challenge weak economy coupled number endemic health challenges malaria hiv aids with resource hand ethical imperative respond pandemic influenza may fall addressing hyperendemic fatal diseases each country represented asian meeting pandemic flu preparedness plan addressed allocation issue maintained national stockpile antiviral drugs in cases biological vulnerability determined priority thus young old pregnant women immune-compromised individual tended prioritized receive antiviral drugs however asian culture exhibit hierarchy west honor accorded elderly senior staff royalty public service personnel asian cultures in addition expected relative friend powerful unofficially prioritized receive limited resources without considered unethical indeed many asian contexts prioritization viewed social obligation eg health worker would consider offering antiviral limited supply senior official offering resource person one official priority groups nevertheless participant expressed disapproval official abuse power demand extort limited resource one participant described shortage n95 face

minor remote island access medical service resource pandemic the participant questioned whether country plan address challenge certain geographical condition may place equitable distribution resources many participant latin american meeting thought individual right paramount pandemic clear communication plan includes community input process drug allocation would help avoid panic they emphasized importance including sector society including private sectors migrants minority public health decision-making process issues discrimination stigmatization certain sector population must addressed emergency situation arises meeting participant stressed emergency plan take account diversity population must transparent favor equal distribution resources at eastern mediterranean meeting participant discussed need evaluate “what good versus good others ” this included discussing ethical challenge associated distribution scarce resources questions explored included which group people vaccinated first who make decision distribution one theme wa identified discussion wa importance prioritizing healthcare worker access limited resources including medical psychological care social benefits become sick emergency the use social distancing limit transmission wa widely accepted important tool pandemic influenza response participant warned many factor challenge complicate traditional public health measure these include socio-economic factor eg densely populated settings cultural factor eg family duty funeral rituals participants african meeting agreed social distancing principle described 2007 who document 20 including making measure voluntary greatest extent possible ensuring “safe habitable humane condition confinement including provision basic necessity food water clothing medical care etc ” employment protection worker comply social distancing measure wish employers participants stressed isolation quarantine measure difficult enforce rural compared urban area africa due isolated geography rural area lack healthcare worker security officials however participant noted public health measure successfully employed rural area prior epidemic africa densely populated urban slum also noted present challenge social distancing in typical slum dwelling people occupy available sleeping space night small poorly ventilated homes there separate space available isolation quarantine the applies refugee camps in densely populated settings lack freedom movement may lead near-certainty transmission neighboring community tempted protect fencing slum forcibly preventing exit slum residents there wa also concern among participant african country would rely heavily military personnel impose order potentially unnecessary force participants asian meeting also noted challenge associated use social distancing measures duty family major theme confucian philosophy in asian countries tradition friend relative visit even stay hospitalized person in many instances exhortation family friend serious nature isolation match force tradition find way isolation wards due lack resources isolation ward security guards nursing staff able add policing already heavy workload a common concern reported participant asian meeting wa risk stigmatization patient family member placed isolation quarantine one participant reported sars outbreak entire village wa stigmatized wa home one cases anybody known come village wa avoided others workers village admitted place employment outside village similarly student kept schools when village wa eventually quarantined people feared delivering food supplies the stigma remained long epidemic subsided quarantine wa lifted high rate poverty also pose challenge use social distancing measures it difficult patient remain isolation ward potentially exposed individual remain quarantined long period time unless compensation offered lost wages participants latin american eastern mediterranean meeting reflected long history human right abuse countries this made likely view use social distancing measure something considered great caution some even viewed measure human right violations healthcare worker multiple obligations including obligation patients employers governments families participants meeting understood healthcare worker cannot completely sacrifice family members’ health well-being fulfill public health duty emergency response participants african meeting felt healthcare worker right stop working feel well-protected factors discussed included challenge related displacement health worker post-election conflict traditional cultural practice may increase risk disease spread eg hugging handshaking conflict senior official frontline healthcare worker regarding access resources they felt frontline health worker first priority a complicating factor many african country presence large number health-care-related ngos variety countries what obligation would pandemic if worker organization leave country attend need home country families african country could lose sizable proportion health workforce and yet host government little authority demand assistance socio-economic factor predominant story told participant asian meeting for example sars outbreak private hospital one country admitting patient could pay suspected patient go hospital could pay inpatient care could exceed 250 per day country per caput annual income le 3000 some country reported lack personal protective equipment face masks healthcare workers difference degree protection offered according position eg physician offered protection nurses participants reported healthcare worker refused treat suspected cases either protective equipment concerned safety safety loved one would return work the participant agreed healthcare facility government ethical obligation adequately equitably provide personal protective equipment employees in addition participant felt education employee transmission control instances additional incentive hazard pay help overcome hesitancy healthcare worker remain duty pandemic surge cases participants latin american eastern mediterranean meeting also discussed role healthcare worker influenza pandemic participants meeting recognized important responsibility healthcare worker treat patient regardless risk also noted government responsibility protect healthcare workers some participant believed healthcare worker right refuse treatment patient provider fear exposing family society ha obligation compensate family die treating patients other participant felt doctor right refuse treatment oath duty physicians international collaboration complicated many factors including disparity resources political differences ethnic tension distrust participants however agreed pandemic collaboration critical disease respect boundary participants pointed country developed undeveloped ha eliminated poverty underlying cause ill-health lower literacy among poor le knowledge disease prevention the prevalence poverty affect individuals institution systems because interdependence nations participant thought best interest

accounting rule may prevent shift resource purposes even face major global threat the asian meeting participant also expressed concern specimen sharing during outbreak sars h5n1 influenza example china shared specimen country around world research vaccine development 33 during outbreak h1n1 2009 who noted 150 country shared specimens 34 the asian participant noted collaboration communication disease transmission requires transparency odds cultural value ‘protecting honor’ ‘avoiding shamed’ common asia elsewhere reporting outbreak country perceived admitting inadequate disease control asking help another country may viewed sign weakness this complicated often pre-existing dispute neighboring countries moreover helping others also important asian cultural value offering help country

eigenvalue zero real part in particular eigenvalue negative real part equilibrium stable whereas eigenvalue positive real part equilibrium unstable it follows threshold λ max 0 λ max largest

next-generation method developed diekmann et al 8 diekmann heesterbeek 9 popularised van den driessche watmough 10 generalisation jacobian method it significantly easier use jacobian-based methods since requires infection state exposed class infected class asymptomatically infected class ignores state susceptible recovered individuals this keep size matrix relatively manageable however next-generation method suffers lack uniqueness in order determine matrix f v f account “new” infection v account transfer infected compartments biological insight must used order decide term count “new” infection term transfer terms while may seem intuitive models easy construct counterexample 3 i′ βsi−μi βsi 5i−5i−μi here term 5i might represent example new infection arising vertical transmission whereas term −5i might represent disease-specific death rate although construction clearly arbitrary demonstrates identifying “new” infection unique process relies modeller's judgement we

lead different value r 0 n they claim one choice f epidemiologically correct however true example shows furthermore mean definition r 0 relies upon judgement modeller “epidemiologically correct” means furthermore next-generation method doe produce number human infected single human intermediate host rather geometric mean number infection per generation for example consider mosquito-borne disease human infect two mosquitoes mosquito infect three humans shown figure 1 for convenience label r h 2 r m 3 then number human infected primary human via mosquitoes r 0 2 × 3 6 this also value calculated

infects two tick r h 2 tick infects four animal r t 4 animal infects three human r a 3 then single human ha resulted 6 r0 2×4×3 24 infected humans however r0 n 243≈2 88 since three infection stages as
